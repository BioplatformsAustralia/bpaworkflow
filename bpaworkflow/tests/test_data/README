Test cases for BPA Workflow
===========================

Unless noted otherwise, all test cases are based on the submission 
spreadsheet and MD5 checksums files located in the same directory as this
README

These are:
 79639_GAP_AGRF_PAE47351_checksums.md5
 79639_GAP_AGRF_PAE47351_metadata.xlsx

The test cases are currently grouped into directories:

flagged/

 Test cases in this directory are named after the error code they generate
 that is displayed on the BPA Workflow frontend.

not_flagged/

 Test cases in this directory are not currently caught by the BPA Workflow
 frontend.  Further code updates to bpa-workflow and bpa-ingest may be 
 required to catch these errors.
